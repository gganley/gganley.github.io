# The Good
## Pull based
- Easier to tell when something is down
## PromQL
- Having an actual query language than up/down + string message was huge
## Alertmanager
- Enough integrations with the ability to shell out to webhooks need be
## It's what people are using
- It's nice to be a bandwaggon fan, trust me, I spent 95% of my life in New England

# The Bad
## Wasn't designed for HA
- replication
## Performance limited probe configuration
- holy shit this shouldn't be an issue

# The Ugly
## I gave Thanos too many chances
- HOLY SHIT YOUR PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS SUCK. YOUR DOCS LIE. FUCK.
