# Skyrim scribillings 

A weird collection of thoughts and other things


# Armor
Armor is split into three types `heavy armor`, `light armor`, and `clothing`
## Heavy Armor
Used for tanks, people who aren’t concerned with being quiet or subtle. The most damage resistance but also the slowest and heaviest.
### Kinds of heavy armor
* Iron
* Steel
* Dwarves
* Ork
* Ebony
* Daedric

## Light Armor
For those who need to be light on their feet but will be engaged upon. The jack of all trades armor type
### Kinds of light armor
* HIde
* Leather
* Elven
* Scale
* Glass

### Clothing
Used by mages and assassins who are not going to get hit directly with weapons, damage reduction is from other sources such as magic

# Weapons
## Two-handed weapons
For large brutes that want to do one or two brutal strikes. Heavy weapons that do massive damage but swing slowly
### Warhammer
The largest form of melee weapon, does the most damage with the slowest swing. Has a perk that allows it to ignore armor
### Battleaxe
Has perk that causes bleeding damage
### Greatsword
Has perk that allows great sword to critically strike
## One-handed weapons
Able to have either a shield or another sword
### Mace
Perk to ignore armor
### War Axe
Perk to apply bleed damage
### Sword
Perk to have crit chance
### Dagger
Perks in the sneak tree to have extra sneak damage multiplier

## Archery
### Bow
### Crossbow

# Navigation
## Global Map
* Navigation is a fucking bitch, WASD is used to move around and left click is used to mark map and fast travel and so on and so forth
* their is further functionality is available but the most the map should be used for is to set way markers for roads and to fast travel
## Local Map
* Used to navigate around on a room by room basis
* Useful if you lose track of where you are in relation to the rest of the dungeoun
* Reveals itself as parts are discovered which allows you to see where you have not been which is useful for finding new areas that may advance the plot
## Different map icons
## Roads
* Although not necessary to travel on roads it is a good idea for the beginner because they all connect to towns and it allows you to discover new locations in a very predictable and safe manner

# Enchanting
## Soul gems
Soul gems are the vessel of the souls that are used to create enchanted items and charge enchanted weapons. They come in various sizes and every animal has a certain type of soul
1. Grand — Lvl 38+
2. Greater — Lvl 28-37
3. Common — Lvl 16-27
4. Lesser — Lvl 4-15
5. Petty — Lvl 1-3
## Collecting souls
To fill a soul gem you must first collect a soul from a creature, a soul can be collected by either casting the correct spell on the animal in question or using a weapon that is enchanted s.t. it can collect souls. Once a soul is captured it will attempt to fill the smallest available soul gem. This is to say that if you only have Great soul gems and trap a rabbits soul the great soul gem will be filled in one of the great soul gems, a waste.

# Alchemy
Alchemy is the act of making potions. Potions can be used for several uses from as a healing potion to a poison to making the taker invisible. Alchemy is performed at alchemy stations where 2-3 ingredients are combined to create a particular potion. This is also the station where the effects of each ingredient are discovered. Every ingredient contains 4 possible effects. An effect is included in a potion if at least two ingredients share a particular effect. The overall effect(s) of the potion is the total shared effects between the three ingredients (If you want me to expand on it just ask/clarify just ask).

## Potions
Helpful for your character or your allies. Things such as healing potions or invisibility
## Poisons
Harmful to your enemies. Typically applied to a weapon and once the weapon is used on a particular enemy the poison is applied to that enemy.

# Money
In the general case selling things gets you money which gets you materials that you can make things that you can sell or use those things to get new things to sell to make money

Generally the rule of thumb for deciding on what things to pick up is “do I need this item to make something new” or if the item has a high value to weight ratio. A persons threshold for value/weight ratio depends on how far into the game a person is or what they prioritize in an item.

# Towns
Towns, specifically capitols of the 9 holds, act of the center of commerce for the surrounding region. These cities hold the regions ruler, the jarl, whom you can get missions from and be thane to. Shops, Inns, and other establishments can be found which can be useful because all of these are an opportunity to sell things. Each city has its own flavor and set of missions that can be performed in the city. Winterhold is the capitol of the stormcloaks while Solitude is the capitol of the legion, while Markarth has a dark secret the guards refuse to acknowledge but everyone is afraid of.

# Factions

2. Legion
3. Dark Brotherhood

5. Companions
6. Forsworn
7. Daerdra Worshippers

# Exploring
* Remember to loot bodies at every chance you get

* If something looks tough then you probably shouldn’t fight it

# Making shit
* if you get tired of trying to find good weapons you can make them yourself
* remember to improve your weapons so that you don’t fall away from the damage curve
* Enchanted weapons have special abilities such as extra fire damage or the ability to capture souls for further enchanting
* Enchanted armor gives additional skill points to different areas such as +10 to two-handed or +50 carry weight
* Jewelry is an excellent way of making money in Skyrim. Jewelry can also be enchanted for battle enhancement purposes
