I like to switch between color schemes and light/dark mode periodically.
I've always been perplexed by the memetic dunking on light mode.
I don't think the majority of people claiming to have their corneas seared by Discord light mode would actually get eyestrain from looking at it beyond the initial shock.

Today I found [`consult-theme`](https://github.com/minad/consult/blob/7ed43dc795d49cbfae77020b92ea78ef4c9fd3be/consult.el#L4641-L4679)

> Disable current themes and enable THEME from `consult-themes'.
>
> The command supports previewing the currently selected theme.
