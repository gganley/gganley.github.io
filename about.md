# Gregory Ganley

I'm a DevOps Engineer at Savant Systems. Day to day is managing several Kubernetes clusters. Apps that are deployed

- internal telemetry services 
- Savant Cloud software (Jetty, MySQL, redis, memcached, node.js WebSocket servers), 
- internal support websites
- random cronjobs

Prior I lived in beautiful New Jersey working at a FinTech startup. God I miss [pork roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_roll).

In my spare time (of which since becoming a Dad to 2 has been sparce) I'm learning Rust and expanding my skills beyond a simple Kubernetes operator. I'm very interested in the intersection between hardware and software.
